# CS243-Project
Final Fall 2023 CS243 project for Andrew Li and Saketh Mynampati

The layout and tile Jupyter notebook files consolidate the code needed to replicate our project results. Preprocessed and cleaned data can be downloaded from the Google Drive folder so code can be run without having to process original data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XVy6UEcIC-JZ93VFzbvEmrly_yzW6irz?usp=sharing
